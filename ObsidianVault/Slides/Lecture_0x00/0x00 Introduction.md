 ## Course Overview
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Abstract 

::: 
<small>
CS501 is an introduction to the wild world of malware analysis and offensive capabilities development. Students will work to analyze, and emulate a simulated APT:  APT-Chonky-Bear. In order better defend against 
attackers,  this course takes the stance that it is essential to think like an attacker. Therefore,  students will learn the basics of malware reverse engineering, threat hunting and  malware development.

#### Attendance

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Attendance
 is mandatory. Unless cleared with me, you may not asynchronously take the course. 
- While I record lectures, they are often released 2-4 days after they are recorded. 
- I do not take attendance, but if I notice you missing class, it will affect your grade. 
- If you need to miss class for any reason, please contact me


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Class Comms

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- We have a dedicated [[Matrix Server]] `matrix.ch0nky.com` and you are expected to join. Please see the course docs for getting started.
- I will also respond to email, but will be slower there (at least 24-48 hours)
- If you have a personal question about course administration, job stuff, or anything else that you don’t think your fellow classmates can benefit from, you may DM
- If someone else can benefit from the question, please ask it publicly. 
- If you need help, Ask


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Academic Honesty

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- TLDR: Don’t cheat. Thnx
- Cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. 
- Cheating robs you of the experience of writing your own code, and in turn is a waste of your time and money.
- I will not tolerate anything that compromises your ability to learn in this class.
- You’re all adults, and know the drill. 

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Academic Honesty (cont)

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- If you submit code that is identical to another classmates, you will fail the assignment.
- If you collaborate when it is expressly forbidden, you will fail the assignment.
- If you copy and paste code in the real world, you are incurring a lot of personal and institutional risk.
- If you would like to work in a group for homework assignments you can where permitted, but you can’t both submit the exact same code. You also need to clearly identify who you worked with and where your sources came from.

 #### Grading Policies
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- This is not a weed out course. You get what you put in, use the time to learn and try new things.  
- There is a curve, and the average is a B+
- If you are on the border of a letter grade, I will probably bump it.
- I do not curve grades down

#### Difficulty	

:::
::: left 

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- This class is not easy
- It is easy to spend hours on problems that are simple in hindsight
- The capstone will be very time consuming and will require you to work in a group

:::
::: right
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
> [!tip]Trying hard literally pays off!
 Many students have received job offers based on the work they did for the capstone!

 ## No Jail plz
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### DON’T HACK 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- I AM NOT LAWYER.(IANL)
- The  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 1986: bans “
intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization”.
- We will not protect you if you conduct operations or deploy any malware / tools outside your approved lab environment.
- We will not bail you out of jail

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### DON’T HACK 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
-  Do not piss off anybody who has more time and money than you. The laws are intentionally vague, and the 
- Judges are technically illiterate
- You will lose and be made an example of. 
- When in doubt, ask course staff but always error on the side of caution!    


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Seriously, Don’t Hack Without Permission	
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Aside from it being illegal,  immoral, creepy, and risky, you will fail the class.
- Plus,  the payout most criminal hackers get is considerably less than if you do the same job but call it “adversary emulation” or run a threat intel company.

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->

#### Do not F\*ck with the Government

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- The current geopolitical climate is hot.
- Countries haven’t regularly resorted to kinetic action in response to hacking, but that isn’t a hard and fast rule. It is a norm that might not be respected tomorrow 
- Do not, under any circumstances, hack a foreign or domestic government
. They have all the time, all the money, and capabilities that you cannot hope to compete with. 
- If you really want to do this kind of work, go get a clearance.
- Oh and by the way, kinetic  is a euphemism for killing people. 

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Use caution when publishing tools 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 30px"-->
- Plenty of researchers publish offensive security tools
- Some advance the field, some are published for clout. Be careful 
with
 especially sophisticated, easy to use, and low detection tools.
- Our job is to advance the security industry, not make script kiddies look good.
- Think long and hard about the implications of 
submitting
 (for example) a pull request to metasploit or 
open
 sourcing a RAT. 

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Be Thoughtful 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 28px"-->
- Threat actors use open source tools. 
- Don’t be the reason that a hospital gets hit with ransomware.
- If you do decide to publish tools, make sure to also include countermeasures that defenders can use to combat your tool.
- For questions about licenses, responsible disclosure, or advice on whether or not to publish a tool, please contact us! We are happy to provide feedback.

<!-- slide template="[[Title Slide]]" -->
 ## Grading Policy
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Late Policy

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- You are allocated 3 late days for the semester, and may use them at your discretion. 
- You may ask for more late days for extenuating circumstances. I am usually pretty reasonable when it comes to providing extensions.
- Late days may only be used on reverse engineering assignments, or coding assignments.
- There are no late days for the capstone project or exercises.


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Assignment Philosophy: 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 30px"-->
- The questions on homework assignments will increase in difficulty.
- Difficulty should be a spectrum
- Often times the solution is simple
- Simple != easy

 #### RE: Exercises 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Exercises are weekly, quick turn around homework, and in class assignments 
- They are designed to be sanity checks for topics as the course progresses
- They are questions that should take between 5 and 10 minutes 
- Questions will always be based on recent material, but topics build on each other
- Bring your laptop to class.

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- For folks who only have access to  computers that have ARM based CPUs (eg Mac M1/M2) please contact me and I will get you setup on the VMware Learn platform but it is not as smooth as using an a computer with an Intel/AMD CPU

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### More Elaborate Setups

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- This lab setup is not sufficient for a real world triage environment

	- [https://porchetta.industries/](https://porchetta.industries/)
 join the discord
- Join Gradescope (Do it.).
	- You should 
receive
 an email to join Gradescope 
- Download the VMs and setup your development 
environment
	- You will need  very good internet 
connection
 for this. 
	- Coffee shop internet will not cut it.
	- This will take a LONG time. Do not do this the night before 
	- Remnux takes ~1-2 hours to set up if built from scratch
	- Windows takes ~1-2 hours to set up 
	- In both cases, you can kick it off then go AFK
	- You should carve out some time in case you need to debug.
