 ## Course Overview
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Abstract 

::: 
<small>
This course is an introduction to the wild world of malware analysis and offensive capabilities development. Students will work to analyze, and emulate a simulated APT:  APT-Chonky-Bear. In order better defend against 
attackers,  this course takes the stance that it is essential to think like an attacker. Therefore,  students will learn the basics of malware reverse engineering, threat hunting and  malware development.

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- TLDR: C, Windows Internals, Ghidra, implant dev/rev
- This is the fifth time the class is being taught. 
- Depending on how things go, we may cover more or less than what is listed on the syllabus.
- Since this is designed to be current, topics might shift according to current events.

#### Why should you not take this class 
:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- This class is not easy. Far from it.  
- There are plenty of opportunists for your to accidentally spend 30 hours on a problem only to find it was as simple as `i==0` instead of `i=0`
- You will almost certainly spend hours debugging code
- The capstone project is also very hard.
- This class is taught in c. C will happily let you blow your foot off 
- I say this not to scare you, but to be clear: you need a certain amount of academic maturity to succeed in this course! More on difficulty later...

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### [[Policies#Attendance]]
:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Attendance  is mandatory. Unless cleared with me, you may not asynchronously take the course. 
- While I record lectures, they are often released 2-4 days after they are recorded. 
- I do not take attendance, but I do give regular quizzes at the start of class.
- If you need to miss class for any reason, please contact me


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### [[Policies#Communication]]

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- We have a dedicated [[Discord]] server  and you are expected to join. Please see the course docs for getting started.
- I will also respond to email, but will be slower there (at least 24-48 hours)
- If you have a personal question about course administration, job stuff, or anything else that you don’t think your fellow classmates can benefit from, you may DM
- If someone else can benefit from the question, please ask it publicly. 
- If you need help, Ask

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Academic Honesty

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- TLDR: Don’t cheat. Thnx
- Cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. 
- Cheating robs you of the experience of writing your own code, and in turn is a waste of your time and money.
- I will not tolerate anything that compromises your ability to learn in this class.
- You’re all adults, and know the drill.

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
####  Use of ChatGPT/LLMs
:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
-  :smile:  You are welcome to use LLMs to help explain documentation.
- :smile: You can ask LLMs to help you find bugs in your code or to diagnose compiler errors. 
- :smile: You can (try) asking for inspiration for your final project.
- :smile:  You may use LLMs to help write documentation, unit tests and comments
- :no_entry_sign: You may **not** copy and paste code generated by chat GPT and submit it as your own.
-  If I catch you submitting generated code, you are  going to have a bad time.

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Academic Honesty (cont)

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- If you submit code that is identical to another classmates, you will fail.
- If you collaborate when it is expressly forbidden, you will fail.
- If you copy and paste code you don't understand in the real world, you are incurring a lot of personal and institutional risk.
- If you would like to work in a group for homework assignments you can where permitted, but you can’t both submit the exact same code. You also need to clearly identify who you worked with and where your sources came from.

 #### Grading Policies
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
-  <b> This is not a weed out course. </b>
- You get what you put in, use the time to learn and try new things.  
- There is a curve, and the average is a B+
- If you are on the border of a letter grade, I will probably bump it.
- I do not curve grades down
- If everyone in the class crushes it, then everyone gets an A.

#### Difficulty	

:::
::: left 

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- This class is not easy
- It is easy to spend hours on problems that are simple in hindsight
- The capstone will be very time consuming and will require you to work in a group
- You may not work solo unless you're a Grad student.  
:::
::: right
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
> [!tip]Trying hard literally pays off!
 Reminder: many students have received job offers based on the work they did for the capstone!
:::
---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Difficulty (cont)	
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 22px"-->
- Coding assignments will require you to read  documentation
- Reading the documentation can feel tedious but is a valuable skill in and of itself.
- Being a hacker means caring about material that others overlooked/trusted implicitly
- As a hacker, you should enjoy getting into the weeds **
(Or at the very least not be afraid to dive in :)

#### Difficulty (cont)
:::
<!-- element style="font-size: 30px"-->
- Part of reverse engineering is analyzing techniques you have not seen before
- Assignments will regularly have content that has not been previously covered 
- There are no stupid questions but I might tell you to Google it :-)
- Know that when I do send you to lmgtfy, I am not being catty. Finding answers to your own questions is an essential skill!

<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Difficulty (cont)	
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
`<rant>` 
- Most of this content is simple in hindsight
- Simple != easy
- Getting comfortable being lost and 
working  out what is happening  is an essential skill for hacking

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### [[Policies#No Jail]]
:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- I AM NOT A LAWYER. (IANAL)
- The  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 1986: bans “
intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization”.
- We will not protect you if you conduct operations or deploy any malware / tools outside your approved lab environment.
- We will not bail you out of jail

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### [[Policies#No Jail]]
:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
 - Do not piss off anybody who has more time and money than you. The laws are intentionally vague, and the 
	- Judges are technically illiterate
	- You will lose and be made an example of. 
- When in doubt, ask course staff but always error on the side of caution!    


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Seriously, Don’t Hack Without Permission	
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Aside from it being illegal,  immoral, creepy, and risky, you will fail the class.
- Plus,  the payout most criminal hackers get is considerably less than if you do the same job but call it “adversary emulation” or run a threat intel company. 
- Don't ruin it for everyone else

#### Do not F\*ck with the Government

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- The current geopolitical climate is hot.
- Countries haven’t regularly resorted to kinetic action in response to hacking, but that isn’t a hard and fast rule. It is a norm that might not be respected tomorrow 
- Do not, under any circumstances, hack a foreign or domestic government
. They have all the time, all the money, and capabilities that you cannot hope to compete with. **You will lose** 
- If you really want to do this kind of work, go get a clearance.
- ** *Kinetic*  is a euphemism for killing people.** 

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Use caution when publishing tools 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 30px"-->
- Plenty of researchers publish offensive security tools
- Some advance the field, some are published for clout. Be careful 
with
 especially sophisticated, easy to use, and low detection tools.
- Our job is to advance the security industry, not make script kiddies look good.
- Think long and hard about the implications of 
submitting
 (for example) a pull request to metasploit or 
open
 sourcing your final project
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Be Thoughtful 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 28px"-->
- Threat actors use open source tools. 
- Don’t be the reason that a hospital gets hit with ransomware.
- If you do decide to publish tools, make sure to also include countermeasures that defenders can use to combat your tool.
- For questions about licenses, responsible disclosure, or advice on whether or not to publish a tool, please contact us! We are happy to provide feedback.

 ## [[Policies#Grading]] 
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### [[Policies#Late policy]] 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- You are allocated 3 late days for the semester, and may use them at your discretion. 
- You may ask for more late days for extenuating circumstances. I am pretty reasonable when it comes to providing extensions.
- Late days may only be used on reverse engineering assignments, or coding assignments.
- There are no late days for the capstone project or exercises.
- I do not accept submissions for exercises if you are remote.


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Assignment Philosophy: 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 22px"-->
- The questions on homework assignments will increase in difficulty.
- Difficulty should be a spectrum
- Often times the solution is simple
- Simple != easy
- You are rarely expected to complete the totality of an assignment

 #### RE: Exercises 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Exercises are weekly, quick turn assignments (usually in person)
- They are designed to be sanity checks for topics as the course progresses
- Should take 5-10 minutes 
- Questions will always be based on recent material, but topics build on each other
- Bring your laptop to class.

 #### Remarks about Mental Health
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 22px"-->
- I give incompletes to students who have extenuating circumstances: usually medical emergencies.
- Mental health emergencies are medical emergencies.
- There will be some sections that discuss material that may be triggering to some. 
- Warnings will be given over Discord and at the start of such lectures, and attendance is completely optional.

#### To Reiterate

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- I give incompletes.
- If you say the words “I am having a mental health emergency and need an incomplete” you will get one, zero questions asked. 
- Note this means you get about 30 extra days to complete the outstanding work.

 ## Course Lab Environment 
---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Malware = Bad
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- In this class you will be analyzing and running real malware
- In order to reduce the risk of infecting your machine, all suspicious binaries should be run in a malware sandbox
	- This is a way for us to isolate potentially malicious code from  system resources.

 #### [[Virtualization]]
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 18px"-->
- VMWare/Virtualbox/Hyper-V:  hypervisor software.
- Hypervisor: Software to run virtual machines.
 

"A **Virtual Machine** (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC."

#### Course Lab Environment 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- You are free to use any lab setup that you like, but the course staff will only provide technical assistance for VMs and Virtualization software officially supported by the class. 
- See Course Documentation for a walkthrough.
- Remember, take lots of Snapshots. VMs can sometimes be bit unstable.
- Do not deviate from course directions 
- **story time** using the wrong version of mingw
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Mac (ARM) Users	

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- For folks who only have access to  computers that have ARM based CPUs (eg Mac M1/M2)  or less than 16GB of RAM, please contact me and I will get you setup on Azure platform.
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### More Elaborate Setups

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- This lab setup is not sufficient for a real world triage environment
- Depending on interest, we may cover other ways to improve the current setup
- For one, it is obviously a sandbox :) 
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Course Administrative Technology 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Students are required to join the class [[Discord]] server 
- As of now, all assignments are to be  submitted through GradeScope
	- this may change as I explore more virtualization/autograding tech
- Course notes, slides and assignment directions will use Obsidian.md 
- If you see a broken link in a github MD file, it is probably because you need to open it in Obsidian

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Requirements: Programming/scripting

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Python 3: you need to be very proficient with python. If you don't know python, Java is also OK but you will need to learn python :-)
- c/c++/some other systems programming language: you should be able to write simple C programs, know the difference between Stack and Heap memory. I.e. how to manage memory 
- intel x86 assembly: you should be able to read x86 assembly.

- You should understand the basics of what an operating system is. 
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### [[Syllabus#Protocols]] 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- IP: you should know the difference between a private and public IP, the basics of addressing, and know the relationship between a domain name, DNS and an IP address
- TCP: More so the basics of socket programming, less so the internals of how reliability is achieved or what the handshake process looks like.
- DNS: You don't need to understand **how** DNS works, but you need to know what it does.
- TLS: You need to understand what a Certificate Authority is, a TLS cert is, and the basics of establishing secure tunnels 
- HTTP(s): HTTP verbs, request structure, and error codes

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Requirements: Computer

:::

 ## Questions?
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Homework

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Join [[Discord]] 
- Join Gradescope 
- Download the VMs and setup your development 
environment
	- You will need  very good internet 
connection for this. 
	- Coffee shop internet will not cut it.
	- This will take a LONG time. Do not do this the night before 
	- Ubuntu takes ~1-2 hours to set up 
	- Windows takes ~1-2 hours to set up 
	- You should carve out some time in case you need to debug. 
		- Especially so if you plan on using the Azure env. it is brand new and likely to have some issues.


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Homework (Continued)

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- The lab environment is complex to setup: especially for folks who haven't used virtual machines before!
- The first assignment will be released on the course GitHub 
- It will require a working Lab environment
- It may or may not have some Easter Eggs :egg:


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->

#### Discussion	

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- What is malware?
