#### More Definitions

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
 sets of forensic data found when malicious activity occurs. (IPs / domains of a C2 server, hash values of malware, email accounts of phishing email senders..etc)
- Hash value:
 the unique fingerprint of a single file 
- IP address: 
the address of a computer on a network.
- Domain Name:
 an entry for a A/AAAA record used by a DNS servers to map human friendly names (like google.com) to computer friendly IP addresses (8.8.8.8).

#### Refresher: Cryptographic Hash

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Imagine an oracle that has an 
infinite
 memory
- You present them an input 
- If the oracle has not seen the input before, it randomly flips 256 fair coins and returns the binary sequence
- If it has seen the input before, it returns the stored output 
- Cryptographic hash functions, if they are “secure” should be indistinguishable from such an oralce


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Hash Functions

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Sha256 →
 Safe
- SHA1 → unsafe
- MD5 → Very unsafe
- Cryptographic Hash functions will provide a probabilistically unique fingerprint for files. I.e., the probability of finding two inputs with the same hash should be **very** low 


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### Remark about Cryptographic hash functions
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- They take binary sequences of arbitrary length, and produce a fixed size digest
- The probability of finding collisions is 
exponential
 low
- But there are an infinite number of collisions. 
- How is this possible?
- They are black magic

 #### Threat Analysis Pyramid of Pain
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Getting from IOCs -> TTPs:
- Hash -> Tools
: What malware family does this hash belong to? How are all these hashes similar? Can I block every instance of the malware? 
- IP/Domain -> Network Artifact
: How does the malware communicate with the C2? Can I look at common patterns in the network traffic and block that behavior?
- IOC -> TTPs: 
Is there a pattern in the way this group conducts operations? Do they drop multiple malware families? Do they look for specific data? How do I block this activity?

#### Easy…until it isn’t!

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Depending on the actor, the Pyramid of Pain might just be pain. 
- Hashes are easy, 
unless they use polymorphic code
- IPs are easy, 
unless they use thousands of addresses all of which are compromised infrastructure
. Hint: what happens when someone takes over a Kubernetes cluster or an admin cloud account?
- Domains are easy,
 unless they use a domain generating algorithm (DGA) or quickly change them
- Or…you know what if someone compromises a bunch of legitimate sites and use them to carry out  cyber operation?

 #### Different companies see different IOCs
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Antivirus companies (Norton, McAfee) see the malware that attackers use.
- Mail providers (Gmail, Yahoo) see the phishing emails.
- Domain registrars (Namecheap / GoDaddy) see Command and Control registration.
- Nobody sees everything. 
Analysis is hard.
- You’re going to have to work as a team.

 #### Remark on Infosec Savants
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- There are plenty of brilliant people working in infosec, but by and large there is no such thing as someone who has all the answers. 
- In fact, someone who claims they do is likely wrong, lying, or trying to sell you something. 
- There is no Infosec Dr. House. It’s probably just someone with a bit too much self confidence, and they probably are not fun to work with. 
- Cybersecurity is a team sport.

#### Malware Analysis 101

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Static Analysis: Analyzing the code to determine functionality/capabilities without executing/emulating code.
- Dynamic Analysis: Executing, or emulating all or portions of code to determine behavior by 
examining
 runtime artifacts. 
- Today, we will focus on static analysis!


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### What are we actually interested in?

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Who is the malware targeting? 
How do we detect/triage  this malware*? 
	- Banking malware targeting everyone vs the UAE targeting dissidents 
- What can the malware do? Eg file I/O, Network I/O
- What does the malware talk to? What are its C2 servers?
- How does the malware communicate? What is its RPC? What channel does it use to facilitate this?
- What are its quirks? What makes it unique?	
- How do we differentiate this malware from others? 
- Where else is this malware deployed?
- How do we remediate incidents associated to this malware?


---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### How do we begin to answer these questions?
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->

#### Common IOCs 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Domains / URLs / IPs 
- Mutex and Pipe names.
- RPC commands, Debug information..etc
- Files/folders names 
- Executable hash value (md5 / sha256 / blake2b)
- Import hash
- YARA Rule Match 
(we have a whole lecture on this)
- Resources/ section data 


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Static Analysis

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Brief: Analyzing code without running it. 
- Longer: Static analysis involves looking at data stored in an executable file or script to determine its functionality and to extract IOCs if it is 
deemed
 malicious. 

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Where to start? PE/DLLs Files

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Hash The binary. Search for that hash on VirusTotal.
	- WARNING
: DO NOT UPLOAD EVERYTHING TO VT! ADVERSARIES MONITOR VT
	- Or, if the malware beacons out to the C2 from VT, this can be detected. Do not tip off your adversary if you can avoid it.  
- Strings: Look at the C strings found in the file (Null/double null terminated)
- Imports: Look at the libraries 
imported
 by the PE. If you see LoadLibrary, search for where it is called
- Exports: Does it export functions?
- Resources: What 
resources
 are stored in the executable?
- Entrypoint → main 
assembly
 view
- Decompiled View 
- X-refs


---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Recommended Hash functions:

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Defn: Hash 
Collision
: H(x) = H(y) for x != y
- MD5: A very fast, but BUSTED hash function. It is easy to 
generate collisions
 and you should not rely on this on its own. 
- SHA256: More reliable, and as of now has no collisions. 
- ImpHash: md5 hash of the import table. Why did Fireeye choose md5 for the 
algorithm
 if it is “busted”? The answer is it is fast, common, and more difficult to exploit in statically declared imports. Though technically still 
possible

 #### Imports: Why do we care?
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Looking at imports can provide us valuable information about the capabilities of the code!
- Can it Allocate memory? Can it interact with the network? Can it spawn new processes? …etc
- Windows processes are not sandboxed though, and can load additional 
capabilities
 and resources 
dynamically!

<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### Strings 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Tools: strings.exe, Pestudio, Ghidra
- I prefer ghidra as we can specify the types of strings we will search for. 
- To search for strings, click “search” → “for strings”   
- Sometimes, you will find PDB paths, C2 urls, commands, messages…etc
- However, malware authors can easily encrypt strings.

 #### Sections 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- We will spend more time on the PE file format
- For now, keep in mind that data is stored in 
sections
- Typical sections you will see are
- .text: executable code
- .data: global variables/data
- .rdata: read only global variables/data
- .rsrc: PE resources (i.e., 
embedded
 data, icons…etc)

 #### Resources
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Tool: Resource Hacker
- Used to check for 
embedded
 data inside of the PE
- Many malware families will embed the (encrypted) configuration file for the malware inside of the resources section
- Always check the resources!

 #### Symbols/Debugging information
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Program Database (.pdb) files contain debug and symbol information about portable executables
- When compiled with Mingw, the symbols are 
embedded
 in the exe
- Other times, the PDB is external and the path to it is set in the 
binary
- Ghidra can parse symbols

#### X-Refs

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- X-Refs: Cross Reference
- When analyzing code, it can be difficult to determine how to get started 
- Simple questions like “where is the *real* main function?” can be difficult to answer
- Remember, `entry` is not the same thing as the main code
- In fact, if the binary uses SEH, security cookies, and/or a C Runtime, the entry point will NOT be the main function

---
<!-- slide template="[[Split Vertical]]" -->
::: title
 #### X-Refs: Imports 
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Right click the function name, and select show references
- This will find all spots in the code that (probably!) are calling this function
- This can help us determine what specific functions are doing!

#### Reading/editing Assembly 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Ghidra comes with a pretty decent Decompiler! This converts Assembly into C-like code 
- It also supports interactive 
disassembly
- You can rename functions, modify function signatures, and add comments
- Save your work in a ghidra specific database file

#### Finding the actual Main Function

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Malware authors can make this very, very difficult
- In the simple case, where the only functions that come before the main function are startup code for the SEH, C runtime and possible security cookies.
	- Just look for the last 
function
 called in _entry that returns an int.
- Warning
: TLS callbacks are executed before entry and can be used to hide the real entry point
- Finding main: X-refs are your friend!


---
<!-- slide template="[[Title Slide]]" -->
 ## Demo: 
3 ways to find the main function!
---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### General Tips 

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Look for x-refs to suspicious strings
- Look for x-refs to imported functions 
	- Especially Look for calls to LoadLibrary
- C-style main: int main(int argc, char* argv[]){...}
	- It returns an integer! Look for this!
- Practice finding main! Compile a binary and see if you can find the real entry point!

---
<!-- slide template="[[Base Slide]]" -->
::: title
#### When is this  methodology difficult to use?

:::

<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Packed Malware, obfuscated code, dynamically resolved imports...etc
- We will spend lots of time on this.

 #### Wannacry
:::

::: left
<!-- element style="font-size: 24px"-->
- Worm + ransomware that leveraged exploits developed by the NSA
- Spread using “eternalblue” that exploited a bug in Microsoft's SMB protocol
- Hundreds of thousands of computers were affected 
- The kill switch , which is a domain name, was discovered by MalwareTech
	- This stopped the spread of the malware, and prevented potentially billions of dollars of damage
- Let’s see if we can recreate that work
