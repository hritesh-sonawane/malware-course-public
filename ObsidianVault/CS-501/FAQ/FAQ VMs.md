# I can't connect to my VM
- Are you using a VPN? if it isn't in bridged mode, it might be blocking local addresses

## Help! I don't have a desktop anymore!
If your desktop environment (gnome-shell) vanishes for whatever reason, you can either reboot your machine, or run `startx` to 

## Booting the VM takes forever
- It is probably DHCP  (the protocol that is used to assign you an IP address on a network) :-)
- If you see `start job is running for wait for network to be configured` in the console, you're going to want to modify the Vagrant netplan file
- drop into a root shell  with `sudo su`
- `cd /etc/netplan`
-  Modify the vagrant file. Mine looks like this: 
 ```yaml
vagrant@vagrant:~$ cat /etc/netplan/50-vagrant.yaml 
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth1:
      dhcp4: true
      optional: true #<-- added this line 
    eth2:
      addresses:
      - 10.10.10.2/24
    

```
- Notice the optional: true
- If you only have 1 Vagrant Ethernet interface specified, it should look like this 
```yaml
vagrant@vagrant:/etc/netplan$ cat 50-vagrant.yaml 
---
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth1:
      addresses:
      - 10.10.10.2/24
``` 
## The font in the terminal is double spaced
- You can install the full ubuntu desktop, or you can manually change the font in the terminal preferences. 



# Windows

## My mouse stopped working inside of the windows VM
- Verify that you can SSH into the window's VM
- try running calc.exe and see if the window appears
- If it does, try resetting mouse integration by going to `input-->mouse integration` and unckeck, then recheck it.
- Make sure your Graphic Controller (GC) is set to VBoxSVGA (or whatever  Virtualbox tells you is the recommended GC)
- Try detatching the GUI and continuing
- Try sending a CTRL-ALT-DELETE from the VM input menu
