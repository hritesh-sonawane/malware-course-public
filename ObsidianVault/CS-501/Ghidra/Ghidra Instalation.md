These directions are designed to work for Ubuntu 22.04. For all other systems, please read the directions here: https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html

- install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
- Grab the release from github 

## Gotchas 

For MacOS, you will need to allow unsigned execution of the Ghidra Decompiler binary. To do this, navigate to the directory where you installed Ghidra, and enter the following directory `ghidra_10.2.2_PUBLIC/Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/os/mac_x86_64`. Then, open the containing folder: contrl-click the decompiler binary and click `ok` to allow the unsigined executable to be run.  

# Ghidrathon
TLDR: this is a python3 environment for Ghidra that is NOT Jython based. IT relied on JNI so it is **somewhat** unsafe but is perfect for this class.   
Please read the [blog post](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/ghidrathon-snaking-ghidra-python-3-scripting)  and follow the directions [here](https://github.com/mandiant/Ghidrathon#installing-ghidrathon) or  follow the directions in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aatbqf6lcjU)  for installing the plugin.  Make sure to use a  python virtual environment. 

 I provided a script to automate this on Ubuntu, except for the final step of enabling the extension.  In the project menu, click File--> Install Extensions . Select Ghidrathon and click install. It will ask you to restart Ghidra.  Also consider disabling Jython all together.

#### Ghidra Dark Mode 
Allegedly, the NSA is in the process of adding a Dark Mode. Until that happens, this is what I personally use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zackelia/ghidra-dark.git
python3 ghidra-dark/install.py --path $HOME/ghidra_10.2.2_PUBLIC/
```
