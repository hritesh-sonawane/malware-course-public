Package managers are designed to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages. They are typically used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems, but they are also available for other platforms, such as Windows and MacOS. Some examples of package managers include apt for Debian and Ubuntu,  Homebrew for MacOS and choco for Windows. 

# Linux 
- If your primary OS is Linux, then it (usually) comes with a package manager and there is nothing to be done. 
- I personally use Ubuntu but this is primary because I find it intuitive to use, and it generally works without much work.  I also found Mint and  PopOS to be beginner friendly 
- A few friends of mine also rave about Fedora.

# MacOS

- For MacOS,  there is no official package manager. Brew is a popular choice of unofficial package manager. To install run the following script:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 
```
This will walk you through setting up the brew package manager.  For more, see https://brew.sh/

# Windows 

Windows 10 and below do not have an official package manager.  The two big ones are scoop and choco. This course will be make use of choco, but you are welcome to use whatever you want on your host syste. 

I also recommend  installing the boxstarter shell to install choco as well as some other utilities to make package management with Windows easier. To install run the following in an administrative powershell  windows: 

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://boxstarter.org/bootstrapper.ps1')); Get-Boxstarter -Force
```

You should see a new icon on your Desktop: a shortcut to launch the boxstarter shell.
