This course uses a dedicated discord server `ch0nky-devs`

- All communication should be handled either via discord.
- You should receive an invite link at the start of the semester 
- I recommend standing up a separate discord from your personal one. 
- If you get banned from the discord, this likely means you fail the course. Be on your best behavior.
