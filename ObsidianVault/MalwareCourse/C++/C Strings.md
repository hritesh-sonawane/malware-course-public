# C strings for python programmers 


C has no concept of a `string` in that  there is no `string` type. In the standard c library (libc, MSVC) the concept of a string  is a null terminated character array.
Recall that an array in C is a pointer to a contiguous block of memory.


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	char x[] = "Hello!";
	printf("%s\n", x);
	for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		printf(" %02x ", x + i);
	}
}
```


In the C programming language, a string is a sequence of characters that is stored in an array. In C, strings are represented by arrays of characters, with the last character in the array being a null character (`'\0'`) to mark the end of the string. For example, the string "Hello" could be represented in C as an array of characters like this:



`char string[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};`

To work with strings in C, you can use a variety of string manipulation functions that are part of the C standard library, such as `strcpy` to copy a string, `strcmp` to compare two strings, and `strlen` to get the length of a string.
