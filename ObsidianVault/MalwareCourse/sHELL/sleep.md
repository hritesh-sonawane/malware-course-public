### `sleep` - Pause Execution

**Command Name and Help:**

```c
const char Name[] = "sleep";
const char Help[] = "Pause shell execution for a specified number of seconds.\n"
                    "Usage:\n"
                    "    sleep <seconds>";
```

#### Requirements:

- Pause shell execution for a specified number of milliseconds 
- No more than 32 bits for the integer to store the number of miliseconds
- Notice that atoi is not implemented in `core` Is there another function in Kernel32.dll that might be useful?
- Be sure to clean up as needed. 
- Alternatively, you could implement atoi from scratch (Not recommended)
