# README

You job is to implement a decryptor for the ransomware sample listed in the assignments directory.  There is a flaw in its use of cryptography that allows your to decrypt files without the help of the ransomware operators!

# Directions
Write a decryptor in python. See the sample code. 

# Hints: 
- There is a lot of C++ code being used. Try and focus on the core function of the ransomware. 
- There are multiple threads being spanwed to encrypt files. See if you can figure out what function they are calling!
- What is a malware authors favorite cipher to implement? (Hint: its super easy to code up)


# Notes:
To make your life a bit easier, I have included a semit annotated ghidra project file. 

- To open the .bin.gzf (ghidra project file format), just drag and drop it into the project menu like you would a .exe. 

If you get an error, you will need to upgrade/adjust the version of ghidra
To upgrade, run `choco upgrade ghidra`

Complete the template code to decrypt files that have been encrypted with `locker.exe`
