Start this ASAP. 
## Coding 
In this assignment, you will practice using the windows API. I recocmend reading about C++ containers such as  `std::vector`, `std::string`, C++ classes and the Windows API.  

## Required Reading
If you ask me a question that is answered in the following links, I will shame you just a little bit :-). OK not actually but I will politely direct you to one of  the links.

# CRT Restrictions
You are only allowed to use 
`malloc`, `free`, `memcpy`, and `printf` from the C runtime unless otherwise stated. Note that setup code from the c runtime is fine. Calls to forbidden  functions will result in a 0. For example, `fopen` is not allowed for File I/O. You have been warned :)



## Helper Functions 
### `DEBUG_PRINTF`

Here is a macro that will expand based on whether or note `DEBUG` is defined. Please use `DEBUG_PRINTF` for local development. The autograder will be matching values from stdout, and if you call `printf` where you aren't supposed to, it could cause you to lose points. To compile with `DEBUG` defined, you can  either define the macro in the source code (`#define DEBUG`) or you can  define it in the gcc command line `-DDEBUG`. If you do define it in source code, do make sure to remove it when you submit :-)
Note that it is defined  in `debug.h`

```c
#if defined(DEBUG) 
 #define DEBUG_PRINTF(fmt, args...) fprintf(stderr, "DEBUG: %s:%d:%s(): " fmt, \
    __FILE__, __LINE__, __func__, ##args)
 #define DEBUG_HEX(va, n)for(size_t i = 0; i < n; i++){ \
     printf("%02x ", ((unsigned char*)va)[i]) ; }{printf("\n");}
#else
 #define DEBUG_PRINTF(fmt, args...) 
 #define DEBUG_HEX(va, n)
#endif
```

### Basic directions
Read the directions below, and implement code anywhere you see `// Your code here`

To generate a submission for gradescope, please use `make submission` to create a zip archive that contains your makefile, and relevant source code files.
