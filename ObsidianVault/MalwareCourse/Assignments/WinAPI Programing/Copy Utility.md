## File IO
### Copy Utility V0
In this problem, you will implement a simple copy utility.  This program should take 2 arguments, `file_src` and `file_dst`. The program should copy the contents of `file_src` to `file_dst`.

To further give you some practice with pointers, this program must have the following functions:
```c
// ReadFile in chunks and return number of chunks read
DWORD openAndReadFile(LPCSTR lpFileName, PLARGE_INTEGER lpFileSize, BYTE** lpPtrFileBuffer );

// Write file in Chunks and return number of chunks written
DWORD openAndWriteFile(LPCSTR lpFileName, PLARGE_INTEGER lpFileSize, BYTE* lpFileBuffer );
```

You are not allowed tin modify the prototype unless you think there is a typo :-). Noteice that openAndReadFile takes a pointer to a BYTE pointer, and openAndWriteFile takes a byte pointer. Pay special attention to when you dereference. 

#### Reading 
- When reading the file, you should allocate a buffer large enough to store the entire file. 
- You may not assume the file is smaller than 4GB. 
- You should read the file into memory in blocks of size `READ_CHUNK_SIZE` bytes.  
- While reading, you should prevent other processes from modifying  the file (writing, deleting ..etc) but allow for shared reading.
- Once the file is loaded into memory, you should make sure to close the handle to `file_src`
- If an error occurs at any point, print an error message and provide the error code with `GetLastError` 
	- Be sure to clean up all resources (free heap memory, close Handles ...etc

#### Writing 
- Now, start writing to `file_dst`.
- If `file_dst` already exists, you should truncate the file to zero bytes (i.e. overwrite it)
- Prevent other processes from interacting with the file (read, write, delete..etc)
- Write to the file in chunks of size of `WRITE_CHUNK_SIZE
- If an error occurs, close all handles, free all memory, and delete `file_dst`
