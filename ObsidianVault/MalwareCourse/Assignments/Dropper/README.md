In this assignment, you will re-implement features of the Droppers you observed in Epoch-0. In particular, there were two Droppers: one  that implicitly linked against several libraries, and one that used a combination of explicit linking for suspicious libraries and implicit linking for more benign ones. 

You will have to  reverse engineer how each binary works, and will re-implement all of the features you found in it starting at the main function. Note there are no symbols, so it is up to you to find the main function!

To get full credit you must have the following for each binary:
- source code written by you (this is not a team assignment!)
- Identical import address tables. (this will only work if you use the same compiler and the same version!)
- Required functionality 

The required functionality to implement is the following:
- Check if  `C:\malware\ch0nky.txt` exists. If it does not, exit immediately. 
- Download a file from the URL defined in `C2_URL` (See the header files and example.c for more on this)
- Save the file to a temporary path.  The name of the saved file should match the name used in the malware samples.  I.e., if the first Binary saved the file to the path `c:\foo\bar\Candy.exe`, you should also save the binary to that path.  
- Execute the downloaded binary


Hint: What language was the binary written in? (its `c` but what compiler was used?). What version?
