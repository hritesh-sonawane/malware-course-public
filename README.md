![](Ch0nkyBear.png)

This is the public repository for Introduction to Malware, Threat Hunting and Offensive Capabilities Development
It has been taught at Boston University as CS-501, and at Northeastern University as CS-4973/6983

## Brief
The class introduces students to the wild world of offensive capabilities development and cyber threat hunting by taking on the role of both attacker and defender to better understand various stages of cyber attacks. Focusing on the Windows operating system, students will analyze malware deployed by a simulated threat actor APT-Ch0nkyBear in addition to creating their own tools to emulate their capabilities.

## Capstone 
After spending a fair amount of time tearing apart implants, students will work to create a simple implant complete with basic functionality and a multi user C2 server.
