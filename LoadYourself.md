# Load Yourself: by Just-In Beiber (WIP)

## Verse 1
For all the times you got burned by the SOC
Never getting past your first beacon back
Running code straight from the disk for goodness sake 
A rookie move its an instant checkmate 

## Refrain 

## Pre-Chorus 
McAfee caught you, they can't catch anyone
Burned by a crappy pre-installed AV
You were so caught up in your drop, didn't see whats going on
And now you know, you're better running from explorer

## Chorus 
Cause if you think, that I'm, still on the disk 
Then baby you should go and load yourself 
And if you think that I, leave artifcats on systems 
You should Go and Load yourself 






## Chrosu ALT
Cause if you think, that I'm, still on the disk 
Then baby you should go and load yourself 
And if you cling to methods so archaic // And if you think, that I, leave artifacts then//  Your opsecâ€™s weak, your codes a complete mess and therefore
You should Go and Load yourself 


## notes
- there is a joke to be made with "take a page out of my book" (page of memory/playbook )
- :fire: you're a error I won't debug
