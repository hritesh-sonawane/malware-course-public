// openAndReadFile: Opens and reads a file in chunks of 1MB
// Takes a pointer to a LARGE_INTEGER, and a pointer to a BYTE pointer
// It sets the file size in lpFileSize, and sets the value pointed to by lpPtrFileBuffer 
// to the newly allocated buffer
//The file should be locked while it is being read
// You should also only open existing files
DWORD openAndReadFile(LPCSTR lpFileName, PLARGE_INTEGER lpFileSize, BYTE** lpPtrFileBuffer ){
    // your solution here!
